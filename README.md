## Features

* ___Flight Order Creation___: Users can easily create flight orders (tickets) for their desired flights. The API allows users to specify their details, such as passenger seat and row, when creating an order.
* ___Flight Management___: Administrators can add new flights to the system and manage existing ones. The API allows administrators to update flight details, delete flights, and retrieve a list of all flights in the system.
* ___Authentication and Permissions___: The API is secured with token-based authentication using the Django Rest Framework (DRF). Users need to authenticate with a token to create orders, and administrators have exclusive access to flight management actions.
* ___Filtering and Pagination___: The API supports filtering of flight orders based on the source and destination airports. Also filtering is available with every endpoint. Additionally, pagination is implemented to efficiently manage large sets of data.
* ___API Documentation___: The API documentation is automatically generated using DRF Spectacular. It provides a clear overview of available endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements. Filtering is also mentioned in documentation
* ___User-Centric Order Retrieval___: Users can only view and manage their own orders. The API enforces this restriction, ensuring privacy and security.
